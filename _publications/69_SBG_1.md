title: "Pathogen-induced changes in flowering regulation genes in sugarcane smut disease."
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/69_SBG_1
excerpt: '_Sporisorium scitamineum_, the causative agent of sugarcane smut, alters host reproductive development by modulating genes related to flowering and meristem function. This study analyzed early transcriptomic responses (2 days post-inoculation) in resistant (SP80-3280) and susceptible (IAC66-6) sugarcane genotypes using RNA-seq. Key flowering genes (FT, SOC1, AP1) were upregulated in the susceptible genotype, while repressors (HUA2, UBC2) were induced in the resistant one. GO analysis revealed activation of defense responses and cell replication processes. Results indicate that the pathogen differentially manipulates flowering pathways depending on host resistance, highlighting targets for future functional studies.'

Sporisorium scitamineum, the causative agent of sugarcane smut, alters host reproductive development by modulating genes related to flowering and meristem function. This study analyzed early transcriptomic responses (2 days post-inoculation) in resistant (SP80-3280) and susceptible (IAC66-6) sugarcane genotypes using RNA-seq. Key flowering genes (FT, SOC1, AP1) were upregulated in the susceptible genotype, while repressors (HUA2, UBC2) were induced in the resistant one. GO analysis revealed activation of defense responses and cell replication processes. Results indicate that the pathogen differentially manipulates flowering pathways depending on host resistance, highlighting targets for future functional studies.
