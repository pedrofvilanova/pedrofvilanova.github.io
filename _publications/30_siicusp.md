title: "Comparative transcriptomics of two isolates of _S. scitamineum_ with different levels of aggressiveness in sugarcane smut disease"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/30_siicusp
excerpt: 'The biotrophic fungus _Sporisorium scitamineum_ is the causal agent of smut disease in sugarcane, responsible for significant yield losses. Cells carrying different and compatible mating-types are essential for cell fusion and recognition to produce the infective dikaryotic hyphae. Previous studies showed a difference in the aggressiveness of two isolates, SSC04 and SSC39, during sugarcane infection, despite genome similarities, evidenced by comparative analyses. Herein, for the first time, we sequenced the complete genomes of complementary mating-types of the more aggressive isolate SSC04B and less aggressive SSC39A to evaluate the transcriptional profile in search of genetic differences that may justify their distinct behavior in terms of the pathogen aggressiveness.'

The biotrophic fungus Sporisorium scitamineum is the causal agent of smut disease in sugarcane, responsible for significant yield losses. Cells carrying different and compatible mating-types are essential for cell fusion and recognition to produce the infective dikaryotic hyphae. Previous studies showed a difference in the aggressiveness of two isolates, SSC04 and SSC39, during sugarcane infection, despite genome similarities, evidenced by comparative analyses. Herein, for the first time, we sequenced the complete genomes of complementary mating-types of the more aggressive isolate SSC04B and less aggressive SSC39A to evaluate the transcriptional profile in search of genetic differences that may justify their distinct behavior in terms of the pathogen aggressiveness.
