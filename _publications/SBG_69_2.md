title: "Analysis of long non-coding intergenic RNAs (lincRNAs) of _Sporisorium scitamineum_ in interaction with sugarcane."
collection: publications

permalink: /publication/69_SBG_2
excerpt: 'Sugarcane is a globally important crop, but its productivity is threatened by smut disease, caused by the fungus Sporisorium scitamineum. While research has largely focused on protein-coding genes, little is known about non-coding RNAs in phytopathogens. This study identified 69 long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) in _S. scitamineum_, including six mitochondrial transcripts, through transcriptome reassembly. All were expressed in vitro, and six showed consistent expression in planta. These findings highlight the regulatory potential of lincRNAs in fungal pathogenesis and offer new insights for disease control and crop sustainability.'

Sugarcane is a globally important crop, but its productivity is threatened by smut disease, caused by the fungus Sporisorium scitamineum. While research has largely focused on protein-coding genes, little is known about non-coding RNAs in phytopathogens. This study identified 69 long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) in S. _scitamineum_, including six mitochondrial transcripts, through transcriptome reassembly. All were expressed in vitro, and six showed consistent expression in planta. These findings highlight the regulatory potential of lincRNAs in fungal pathogenesis and offer new insights for disease control and crop sustainability.
