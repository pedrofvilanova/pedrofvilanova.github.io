excerpt: '_Sporisorium scitamineum_, the causal agent of sugarcane smut, exhibits varying aggressiveness among isolates, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We sequenced telomere-to-telomere genomes and transcriptomes of two Brazilian isolates with contrasting virulence. Despite low expected diversity, we found genomic polymorphisms, including mutations in pathogenicity-related genes and structural variants at mating-type loci. Transcriptomic data revealed that the aggressive isolate upregulates plant cell-wall degrading enzymes, hyphal growth genes, and xenobiotic metabolism during early infection. Distinct effector expression patterns were also observed. These findings reveal isolate-specific strategies and provide insights for improving sugarcane resistance and disease management.'

Sporisorium scitamineum, the causal agent of sugarcane smut, exhibits varying aggressiveness among isolates, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We sequenced telomere-to-telomere genomes and transcriptomes of two Brazilian isolates with contrasting virulence. Despite low expected diversity, we found genomic polymorphisms, including mutations in pathogenicity-related genes and structural variants at mating-type loci. Transcriptomic data revealed that the aggressive isolate upregulates plant cell-wall degrading enzymes, hyphal growth genes, and xenobiotic metabolism during early infection. Distinct effector expression patterns were also observed. These findings reveal isolate-specific strategies and provide insights for improving sugarcane resistance and disease management.
