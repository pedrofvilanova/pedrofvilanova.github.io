title: "Compatibility analysis in crossing reactions (mating-type) between smut fungi species"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/28_siicusp
excerpt: 'The biotrophic fungus _Sporisorium scitamineum_ causes sugarcane smut disease, one of the most relevant diseases of sugarcane crops. Compatible cells recognize and fuse, giving rise to the infectious dikaryotic hyphae, capable of colonizing the host tissues. After penetrating the plant’s surface, colonization becomes systemic and intense proliferation occurs within the host’s meristematic tissues. Here, we isolated sporidial haploid cells and assess interspecific sporidial mating in vitro among four smut fungi species: _S. scitamineum_, _S. panici-leucophaei_, _Ustilago maydis_, and _Ustilago hordei._'
