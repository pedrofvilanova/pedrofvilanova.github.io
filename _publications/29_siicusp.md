title: "Comparative genomics of two isolates of _S. scitamineum_ with different levels of aggressiveness in sugarcane smut disease"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/29_siicusp
excerpt: 'Effectors are molecules secreted by pathogens to establish colonization by manipulating the plant immune system and metabolism. As a counterattack, the immune system of hosting plants evolve rapidly, mainly through the known R (resistance) genes, imposing selection pressure on pathogens and their effectors. Many pathogens attack important crops, and understanding the arsenal of effectors molecules and the mechanisms to surpass crop resistance may benefit worldwide breeding programs. Herein, we sequenced the wholegenome of an aggressive isolate (SSC04) of the biotrophic fungus _Sporisorium scitamineum_, the causing agent of sugarcane smut disease. We then performed whole-genome alignments between SSC04 and a reference genome (SSC39) (Taniguti et al., 2015) and investigated whether the predicted candidate effectors (CE) were polymorphic among isolates.'
