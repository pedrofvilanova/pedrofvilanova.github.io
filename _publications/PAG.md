excerpt: '_Sporisorium scitamineum_, the fungus causing sugarcane smut, shows isolate-specific gene expression during early infection. We compared transcriptional profiles of two isolates with different virulence levels in resistant and susceptible sugarcane genotypes. Of the 3,452 genes expressed by the low-virulence isolate, 96% were also expressed by the high-virulence isolate, but key effector genes showed distinct and sometimes opposite expression patterns. Notably, a chitin deacetylase was strongly upregulated in resistant plants infected by the low-virulence isolate. These findings emphasize the role of host-pathogen interactions in disease outcome and suggest paths for developing resistant sugarcane cultivars.'

Sporisorium scitamineum is the smut fungi causing persistent disease in sugarcane fields worldwide. Here, we report on the genomic differences between strains (HV -high virulence and LV- low virulence) of two haplotypes and their respective mating types, their impacts on virulence, and expression profiles when infecting two contrasting sugarcane genotypes 48 h post-inoculation. We used a combination of Oxford Nanopore (20xcoversage) and Illumina (60xcoverage) sequencing platforms to generate high-quality chromosome-level sequences (200 X coverage) of four haploid strains of S. scitamineum. We used long nanopore reads to genome assemble (Canu v.2.2) and short Illumina reads to polish the final versions (Medaka v1.2.2 and Pilon v.1.24). We also report the HV isolate's transcription profile (RNAseq) infecting contrasting sugarcane genotypes 48 hours post-inoculation (hpi) with a deep sequencing coverage (1,027,426,235 paired-end reads of inoculated plants, resulting in 868,330 of fungal reads). We used FastQC v.0.11.5 and Cutadapt v.1.18 to assess read quality and to remove library adapters, low-quality reads (Q < 20), and ambiguous bases (N). To map the reads against the fungus reference genome and count to define DEGs, we used Hisat2 v.2.1.0, featureCounts v.1.6.0 from the Subread package, and edgeR v.4.0.16. Our findings reveal genomic variation confined to a few loci, with most SNVs occurring between isolates rather than within complementary matings. The transcription profile depicted the influence of the plant genotype on expression profiles of detoxification of xenobiotics and the differential expression of candidate effectors (CEs) in shaping fungal virulence.
