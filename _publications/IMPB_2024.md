excerpt: '_Sporisorium scitamineum_, the fungus causing sugarcane smut, shows isolate-specific gene expression during early infection. We compared transcriptional profiles of two isolates with different virulence levels in resistant and susceptible sugarcane genotypes. Of the 3,452 genes expressed by the low-virulence isolate, 96% were also expressed by the high-virulence isolate, but key effector genes showed distinct and sometimes opposite expression patterns. Notably, a chitin deacetylase was strongly upregulated in resistant plants infected by the low-virulence isolate. These findings emphasize the role of host-pathogen interactions in disease outcome and suggest paths for developing resistant sugarcane cultivars.'
