Hi there! I’m a biologist and Master’s student in Genetics and Plant Breeding at the University of São Paulo (USP). Currently, my research focuses on fungal genomics, with a particular emphasis on understanding sugarcane smut disease, a major challenge for agriculture. I use comparative genomics and transcriptome profiling to explore genetic variability and gene regulation in fungal pathogens.

In addition, I am deeply passionate about Human Genetics, aiming to pursue a PhD in this field to advance research on genetic mechanisms driving cancer. 

🔬 Areas of interest:

1. Genomics and Transcriptomics Technologies
2. Microbiome interactions
3. Computational Biology and Bioinformatics
4. Human Genetic Disease
5. Epigenetics and DNA Methylation
6. Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Genetics

I’m always open to new collaborations and discussions in genetics, genomics, and related fields. If you’re interested in working together or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
