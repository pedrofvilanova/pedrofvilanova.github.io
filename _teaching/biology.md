I taught Biology for one year at the State Technical School "Deputy Ary de Camargo Pedroso", where I designed and conducted interactive experiments to engage students in scientific inquiry. Alongside hands-on activities, I delivered theoretical lessons aimed at building a strong foundational understanding of biological concepts, fostering both curiosity and critical thinking in the classroom.
